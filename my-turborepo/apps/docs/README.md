## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

To create [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/router-handlers) add an `api/` directory to the `app/` directory with a `route.ts` file. For individual endpoints, create a subfolder in the `api` directory, like `api/hello/route.ts` would map to [http://localhost:3001/api/hello](http://localhost:3001/api/hello).
