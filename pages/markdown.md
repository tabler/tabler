Well, she turned me into a newt. Burn her! We want a shrubbery!! Well, I got better. Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.

Listen. __Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government.__ *Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.* The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.


## Well, Mercia's a temperate zone!

You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits! A newt?

1. Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
2. I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!
3. We found them.


### What do you mean?

Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed! The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.

* The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice!
* Be quiet!
* Bloody Peasant!

Well, I got better. Camelot! A newt? We want a shrubbery!! The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.

Shut up! …Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? I'm not a witch. Well, we did do the nose.

Well, how'd you become king, then? Shut up! Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!

You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!

Bloody Peasant! What a strange person. Burn her anyway! Camelot! You don't vote for kings.

You don't vote for kings. I dunno. Must be a king. How do you know she is a witch? Why? I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water!
