				<h1>1/1 Text</h1>
				<p>I'm not a witch. Now, look here, my good man. Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed! Well, I didn't vote for you. You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! Bring her forward! He hasn't got shit all over him. He hasn't got shit all over him. We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us.</p>
				<p>Well, we did do the nose. Why? Now, look here, my good man. Be quiet! Well, what do you want?</p>

				<p>What do you mean? We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. I have to push the pram a lot. No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. What a strange person.</p>

				<p>And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. We found them. Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.</p>
