## 🚀 Features

We've created this admin panel for everyone who wants to create templates based on our pre-made components. Our mission is to deliver a user-friendly, clear and easy administration panel that can be used by both simple websites and sophisticated systems. The only requirement is basic HTML and CSS (and some [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki)) knowledge — as a reward, you'll be able to manage and visualize different types of data in the easiest possible way!

* **Responsive:** With the support for mobile, tablet and desktop displays, it doesn’t matter what device you’re using. Tabler is responsive in all major browsers.
* **Cross Browser:** Our theme works perfectly with the latest Chrome, Firefox+, Safari, Opera, Edge and mobile browsers. We work hard to provide continuous support for them.
* **HTML5 & CSS3:** We use only modern web technologies, such as HTML5 and CSS3. Our theme includes some subtle CSS3 animations, which will help you attract attention.
* **Clean Code:** We followed Bootstrap’s guidelines carefully to make your integration as easy as possible. All code is handwritten and W3C valid.
* **Demo pages**: Tabler features over 20 individual pages using various components, which gives you the freedom to choose and combine. All components can vary in color and styling that you can easily modify using Sass. Sky is the limit!
* **Single Page Application versions:** [Tabler React](https://github.com/tabler/tabler-react) has React components for Tabler.

## 📦 Setup environment

To use our build system and run our documentation locally, you'll need a copy of Tabler's source files. Follow the steps below:

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/), which we use to manage our dependencies.
2. Navigate to the root `/tabler` directory and run `pnpm install` to install our local dependencies listed in `package.json`.
3. [Install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) - the recommended version is [2.7.6](https://cache.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/2.7/ruby-2.7.6.tar.gz).
4. [Install Bundler](https://bundler.io) with `gem install bundler` and finally run `bundle install`. It will install all Ruby dependencies, such as [Jekyll and plugins](https://jekyllrb.com).

**OSX users**:

1. NPM ```pnpm install```
2. install Ruby (2.5.* recommended)
	```brew install ruby @2.5```
3. install bundler
	```gem install bundler```
4. install
	```bundle install```
- if bundler get any errors try
```
sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
sudo xcode-select --install
```
5. Run NPM
	```npm run start```


**Windows users**:

1. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) in `C:\Program Files\git\bin` directory and run `npm config set script-shell "C:\\Program Files\\git\\bin\\bash.exe"` to change the default shell.
2. [Install Ruby+Devkit](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) - the recommended version is [2.7.6](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller2/releases/download/RubyInstaller-2.7.6-1/rubyinstaller-devkit-2.7.6-1-x64.exe).
3. [Read guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/) to get Jekyll up and running without problems.

Once you complete the setup, you'll be able to run the various commands provided from the command line.


## Build locally

You need to have `pnpm` and `bundler` installed.

1. From the root `/tabler` directory, run installation in the command line:
  - `pnpm install` 
  - `bundler install` 
2. Then execute `pnpm run start-plugins` to start up the application stack.
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser, and voilà.
4. Any change in the `/src` directory will build the application and refresh the page.

**Note**:
Run `pnpm run build` for reforms a one off build application without refresh.
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to configure the Web server.

## Installation

Tabler is distributed via npm.

```sh
npm install --save @tabler/core
```

## Running with Docker

**Plain Docker**

If you don't want to install node/npm/ruby and the dependencies on your local environment, you can use the provided Dockerfile to build a docker image.
This Dockerfile is provided as an example to spin-up a container running Tabler.

Example of how to use this image:

1. Build the tabler image : `docker build -t tabler .`
2. Run the tabler image while mounting the `src` directory as well as the `_config.yml` file into the container.

Don't forget to expose the port 3000 so you can browse the website locally.
You can also expose the port 3001 to have access to BrowserSync

```sh
docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 -v $(pwd)/src:/app/src -v $(pwd)/_config.yml:/app/_config.yml tabler
```

Now open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Edit anything in the `src/` folder and watch your browser refresh the page after it has been rebuilt.

**Docker Compose**

You can also use the docker compose config from this repo. Use `docker compose build && docker compose up` or `docker compose up --build` to build and start the container. Edit anything in the `src/` folder the same way as with plain docker and access the same URLs and ports in your browser.

### CDN support

All files included in `@tabler/core` npm package are available over a CDN.
