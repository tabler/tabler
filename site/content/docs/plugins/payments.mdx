## Installation

This part of Tabler is distributed as plugin. To enable it you should include `tabler-payments.css` or `tabler-payments.min.css` file to your page.

You can also include plugin via CDN:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="$TABLER_CDN/dist/css/tabler-payments.min.css">
```

## Payment

To create a payment provider icon, add the `payment` class to a component and specify the payment provider. The full list of payment providers can be found below.

```html example code plugins="payments" separated centered
<span class="payment payment-provider-shopify"></span>
<span class="payment payment-provider-visa"></span>
<span class="payment payment-provider-paypal"></span>
```

## Payment sizes

Using Bootstrap’s typical naming structure, you can create a standard payment, or scale it up or down to different sizes based on what’s needed.

```html example code plugins="payments" separated centered
<span class="payment payment-xl payment-provider-shopify"></span>
<span class="payment payment-lg payment-provider-visa"></span>
<span class="payment payment-md payment-provider-paypal"></span>
<span class="payment payment-sm payment-provider-amazon"></span>
<span class="payment payment-xs payment-provider-blik"></span>
```

## List of available payment providers

Select an icon from the list of payment providers. Each icon comes in two color variants - light and dark, so you can choose the one that goes well with your design.
