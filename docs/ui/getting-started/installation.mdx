This guide will take you through the essential steps to set up Tabler in your project, from creating a basic HTML file to incorporating Tabler’s styles and scripts. Let’s dive in!

<div className="steps">

### Step 1: Create a Basic HTML File

Begin by creating a new `index.html` file in the root of your project. This file will serve as the foundation for your Tabler-based interface. Include the basic HTML structure and a `<meta name="viewport">` tag for proper responsiveness:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <title>Tabler demo</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

### Step 2: Add Tabler CSS and JavaScript

Enhance your page by including Tabler's CSS and JavaScript files. Use the following links to load the core Tabler styles and scripts from the CDN:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="$TABLER_CDN/dist/css/tabler.min.css">
<script src="$TABLER_CDN/dist/js/tabler.min.js"></script>
```

Update your HTML file to include these resources:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <title>Tabler Demo</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="$TABLER_CDN/dist/css/tabler.min.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, Tabler!</h1>
  <script src="$TABLER_CDN/dist/js/tabler.min.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

This setup includes the Tabler CSS and JavaScript via a CDN, providing a responsive and functional base for your project.

You can also download the files and include them locally in your project. For more information, see the [Download](/docs/ui/getting-started/download) page.

### 3. Open in Your Browser

Save the file and open it in your browser. You should see your first Tabler-powered page! From here, you can start adding layouts and components to create a fully functional and visually appealing web application.
