## Set up the environment

To use our build system and run our documentation locally, you'll need a copy of Tabler's source files. Follow the steps below:

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/), which we use to manage our dependencies.
2. Navigate to the root `/tabler` directory and run `npm install` to install our local dependencies listed in `package.json`.
3. [Install Ruby](https://ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) - the recommended version is [2.5.5](https://cache.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/2.5/ruby-2.5.5.tar.gz).
4. [Install Bundler](https://bundler.io) with `gem install bundler` and, finally, run `bundle install`. It will install all Ruby dependencies, such as [Jekyll and plugins](https://jekyllrb.com).

### Windows users
1. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) in `C:\Program Files\git\bin` directory and run `npm config set script-shell "C:\Program Files\git\bin\bash.exe"` to change the default shell.
2. [Install Ruby+Devkit](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) - recommended version is [2.5.5](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller2/releases/download/RubyInstaller-2.5.5-1/rubyinstaller-devkit-2.5.5-1-x86.exe).
3. [Read guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/) to get Jekyll up and running without problems.

Once you've completed the setup, you'll be able to run the various commands provided from the command line.

## Build Tabler locally

1. From the root `/tabler` directory, run `npm run start` in the command line.
2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser, and voil√†.
3. Any change in `/src` directory will build the application and refresh the page.
