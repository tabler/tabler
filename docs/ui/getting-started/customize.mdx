## Custom Google Font

To use a custom Google Fonts font in Tabler you must import the font in the `<head>` section of the page. In this example we will use the _Inter_ font:

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@300;400;500;600&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

Now you just need to tell Tabler to use your favorite font:

```html
<style>
  :root {
    --tblr-font-sans-serif: 'Inter';
  }
</style>
```
