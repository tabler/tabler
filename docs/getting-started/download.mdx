## CDN via jsDelivr

All files included in `@tabler/core` npm package are available over a jsDelivr CDN. Use it to deliver cached version of Tabler’s compiled CSS and JS to your project.

```html
<script src="$TABLER_CDN/dist/js/tabler.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="$TABLER_CDN/dist/css/tabler.min.css">
```

You can also include additional Tabler plugins:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="$TABLER_CDN/dist/css/tabler-flags.min.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="$TABLER_CDN/dist/css/tabler-payments.min.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="$TABLER_CDN/dist/css/tabler-vendors.min.css">
```

## Package managers

Install Tabler in your Node.js powered apps with the npm package:

<TabsPackage name="@tabler/core" />

dependency trees and need to be installed by using npm install. We support the following packages as of writing.
