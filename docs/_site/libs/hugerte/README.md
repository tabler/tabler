# HugeRTE

The 100% free fork of the world's #1 open source rich text editor.

Used and trusted by millions of developers, [TinyMCE](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce) (the original project we've forked) is the worldâ€™s most customizable, scalable, and flexible rich text editor. However, they changed the license of TinyMCE 7 to GPLv2+ (or a commercial license) while it has been MIT for TinyMCE 6 and LGPL for older versions. This creates problems for users (see [the discussion](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/issues/9453)) so a fork has been created here. It has originally been named HugeMCE, however, due to [potential trademark confusion with TinyMCE](https://github.com/hugerte/hugerte/issues/1#issuecomment-2373423311), it has been renamed to HugeRTE before its publishment to npm.
