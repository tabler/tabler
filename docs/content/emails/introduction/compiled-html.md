## Compiled version of the template

If you only want to change content (text or images) of the email template, you can just use the compiled HTML files - `compiled.html`. They are ready to use, and you need only a basic knowledge of HTML to modify them.

## How to modify the compiled HTML files

1. Open the `compiled.html` file in your favorite code editor.
2. Find the content you want to change inside the `<body>` element.
3. Modify the content as needed:
* Change the text, which is mostly placed inside the `<p>` or `<h1>` tags.
* Change the images by replacing the `src` attribute of the `<img>` tag.
* Change the links by replacing the `href` attribute of the `<a>` tag.
* Remove the HTML elements you don't need, but only if you're sure that they are not necessary for the email template to work correctly.
4. If you changed the images, make sure to replace them in the `assets/` folder.
5. Remove all the images you don't use from `assets/` to reduce the size of the email template.

## How to use the compiled HTML files

After changing the templates as needed, you can use them in your email campaigns.
The `compiled.html` file with the `assets/` folder should be sent to your email marketing tool, like Mailchimp, SendGrid, or any other.
