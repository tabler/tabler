## Text selection

Change the way in which the content is selected when the user interacts with it.

```html example columns={1} centered separated
<p class="user-select-all">This paragraph will be entirely selected when clicked by the user.</p>
<p class="user-select-auto">This paragraph has default select behavior.</p>
<p class="user-select-none">This paragraph will not be selectable when clicked by the user.</p>
```

## Pointer events

Tabler provides `.pe-none` and `.pe-auto` classes to prevent or add element interactions.

```html example columns={1} centered separated
<p>
  <a href="#" class="pe-none" tabindex="-1" aria-disabled="true">This link</a> can not be clicked.
</p>
<p><a href="#" class="pe-auto">This link</a> can be clicked (this is default behavior).</p>
```
