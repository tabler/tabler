## Installation

Follow these steps to set up Tabler for development:

1. Fork the repository: [Guide to forking](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

2. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tabler.git
   ```

3. Create a new branch for your changes:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name

## Development

To set up Tabler for development, follow these steps:

<div className="steps">

### Ensure Node.js and npm are installed

You’ll need Node.js (v20 or higher) and pnpm to compile Tabler’s files. If you don’t have them installed, download and install them from the official websites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

### Install dependencies

Run the following command to install all required npm packages. We recommend using pnpm for faster installation:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Start developer mode

Use the following command to enable autocompilation with live reload. This will start a local server at `http://localhost:3000/`:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

### Make changes

Make your changes in the appropriate folders, such as `./src/` or `./docs/`. Avoid modifying files in `./dist/`, as they are auto-generated during the build process and will be overwritten.

## Compiling for Production

Before submitting a pull request, ensure your changes are properly compiled and tested:

1. Compile the production files

	```bash
	pnpm run build
	```

2. Test all pages to confirm everything works as expected.

## Submitting Your Contribution

Once your changes are ready, create a pull request (PR) on GitHub. Make sure to include a clear and concise description of the changes and their purpose. Thank you for contributing to Tabler!
