## Documentation Standards

- Always write documentation in English (not Polish) for technical content
- Use clear, descriptive headings with proper hierarchy (##, ###)
- Include practical examples with code snippets
- Add explanations for each component's purpose and usage
- Use consistent formatting for code blocks and examples

## CSS/SCSS Guidelines

- Follow Tabler's CSS custom properties pattern: `--#{$prefix}component-property`
- Use semantic class names that describe purpose, not appearance
- Maintain consistent spacing and indentation in SCSS files
- Group related styles together with clear comments
- Use Bootstrap-compatible class naming conventions

## Component Documentation Structure

- Start with a brief description of the component's purpose
- Show basic usage examples first
- Include variations and modifiers
- Add accessibility considerations where relevant
- Provide code examples that are copy-paste ready

## File Organization

- Keep documentation files in `docs/content/ui/components/`
- Use consistent naming: lowercase with hyphens
- Include frontmatter with title, summary, and description
- Link to Bootstrap documentation when relevant

## Code Examples

- Use Liquid templating syntax for dynamic examples
- Include both HTML and rendered output
- Show responsive behavior where applicable
- Demonstrate proper accessibility attributes

## Git Commit Messages

- Use English for commit messages
- Follow conventional commit format when possible
- Be descriptive about what was changed and why

## Project-Specific Conventions

- Tabler uses Bootstrap 5 as a foundation
- Custom components extend Bootstrap functionality
- Documentation should be comprehensive but concise
- Examples should be practical and immediately usable
